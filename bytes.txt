1.Bits:
A bit is the smallest unit of information in computing and digital communications. It is represented as either “1” or “0”.Eight bits make a byte (8 bits = 1 byte).

2.Bytes:
Byte is the basic unit of information in computer storage and processing. A byte consists of 8 binary digits (bits), each of which consists of a 0 or 1. (1 byte = 8 bits).

3.Kilobytes:
The kilobyte is the smallest unit of memory measurement but greater than a byte. A kilobyte consists of 1024 bytes, abbreviated as ‘K’ or ‘KB’. Kilobytes are mostly used to measure the size of small files.

4.Megabytes:
Megabytes are mostly used to measure the size of large files, abbreviated as "MB". For ex, a high-resolution JPEG image might range in size from 1-5 megabytes. (1 MB = 1024 KB).

5.Gigabytes:
Gigabytes, are sometimes also abbreviated as “GB” and are often used to measure a storage device’s capacity. For ex, a standard DVD drive can hold 5 GB of data. (1 GB = 1024 MB).

6.Terabytes:
Mostly the storage capacity of large storage devices is measured in TeraBytes. HDDs are measured in Terabytes e.g., a typical internal HDD may hold 2 Terabytes of data whereas some servers that contain multiple hard drives may even have a total storage capacity of over 10 Terabytes. (1 TB = 1024 GB).

7.Petabytes:
PetaBytes are used to measure the total data stored in large networks or server farms. For ex, Internet Giants like Google and Facebook store more than over 100 PBs of data on their data servers. (1 PB = 1024 TB).

8.Zetabytes:
Zettabyte is used to measure large amounts of data and all the data in the world is just a few zettabytes abbreviated as "ZB". (1 ZB = 1024 x 1024 PB = 10,48,576 PB)
